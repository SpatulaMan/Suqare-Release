			Your dream to become a mercenary has come true. I hope you're proud of yourself. Now, let me 
			tell you what you have to work with. I've equipped the place with a shop where you can buy 
			equipment and upgrades, a few people who will share hints, and a manager who will always have
			a list of jobs for you to choose from. To interact with any of them, just walk up to them, and
			the menu will pop up. To exit the menu, just walk away from them. Use Q,E to search through 
			equipment in the shop and available jobs, but know that there might only be 1 job at certain 
			times. 
			
			Before you head out on a mission, make sure you equip some weapons from your personal armory.
			You don't have much now, but if you leave a mission with a new weapon in your inventory, it'll
			be added to the armory for use at any time.
			
			These are tumultuous times. 6 large corporations are all vying for control in the public and
			private sectors. While they show their good side to the public, many of them do some shady 
			dealings behind closed doors. These 6 companies will be your primary source of jobs, but 
			decide for yourself if the job fits your moral code. It won't always be pretty, but you have an
			opportunity to make this world better or much worse. Use your head out there.
