Go into a room to mediate a talk about inheritance. 

They argue about stuff, lights go out, guy dies there. Do small investigation, choose who did it by shooting them. Fight ensues and you need to survive and stop the guards that were with 
that person. Once they're all dead, see who's left to get an inheritance. More people left, the bigger the reward is. If you get it wrong, the person who actually did it will inherit the
company and send mercenaries after you. They'll say that they come from that company and that you got it wrong and they're here to finish the job.
