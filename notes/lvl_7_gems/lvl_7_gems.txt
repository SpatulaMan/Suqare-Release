Blue locked door. Can't get in without lock pick. If you don't have one, go to the back of the building. Purple square there. If you give him a good enough weapon (MG or greater)
then he will give you a blue key. You also notice a red key door on the back of the building. There is no Red key anywhere in this level. If you have a lockpick, you can get in 
through the Red door, and it'll lead you straight to the first set of stairs, bypassing the first encounter entirely. If you try to fight the purple guy and kill him, he drops
a really cool weapon (flamethrower or shotgun. Depending on choices you make or chance?), but he's probably the hardest enemy in the game. If you never attack him, he won't attack you. 
That means he'll show up periodically to trade you good stuff for a weapon or maybe money. 

First level, evade bad guys. Any bullets alert everyone on that level so it becomes extremely difficult if you alert anyone. Sneak to the stairs. 1 gem will be on the second floor, and 
the other two gems will be on the other two sections to the left and right of the second floor. Swimming with enemies. 

Get however many gems you stole originally back from them to stop the operation. 

Failure just means that company keeps going with their master plan.
